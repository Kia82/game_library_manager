# My Personal Project

## Game Library Manager

### What is it about?
This project is a basic game library application. It is tailored to anyone who 
wants to have digital game library manager. This manager has the capability to represent the data 
to run basic commands like adding games, removing games, editing games, and displaying the entire game library. 

### Who will use it? 
This tool will be used by individuals who want a game manager and 
are not so intrigued by having a game manager with fancy features.

### Why is this project of interest to me?
I typically use a game library to manage all my games as well as keep track of information about the game.
Being able to create something that I use so often on a daily basis is something 
that interests me.

## Phase 4: Task 3

### Reflection

If I had more time, one of the first things I would do is adding more exceptions and forced formatting
guidelines that the user had to abide by. Additionally, I would consider making more methods and adjust the
layout of the methods to help improve repetition of code and readability in the GUI class.
